// ideas
/housekeeping
    registrar can set schoolYear
        this changes all ACTIVE students sy to new sy
        principal, accountant, prereg doesnt need schoolyear input anymore
    registrar can promote ALL ACTIVE students year level
/returning students
    active: false
        request for activation
    registrar new tab for requests, unarchive

// optimization
set password limit in reset password and set proper default password (?) ADMIN REGISTRAR PRINCIPAL MODULES

// polishing
check semicolons on if and then and catch blocks, weird
change the last res.something() of each last .then() for reach route / res.status is important ata? (frontend)
res.json na gamitin mo for route responses to client

// ideas 
github edu, use it, use learn_one email api
create move route functions to controllers?
could merge subject and teacher in section
cors (added)(cant test w postman) <- learn what for (?)

roles: int
admin: 0
principal: 1
accountant: 2
registrar: 3

//PRINCIPAL
//edit section (best not enable this yet)(these fields are also referenced in grade, find fix)
router.put('/principal/sections/:id', isAuth, isPrincipal, async (req, res) => {
    try {
        let section = await Section.findOneAndUpdate(
            { _id: req.params.id },
            { $set: { 
                schoolYear: req.body.schoolYear,
